								<h2>Script Kiddiez</h2>
								<p>The name "script kiddiez" is a nod to our collective origin in the IT world. All of us had been more or less game hackers before we enrolled in RMIT. The name also refers humourously to our inexperience in coding and IT in general when we started the group.</p>

						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	Most members are introverted, except for Truc. Thus, it is difficult to actually work as an active team. Most members would like to work independently on their share of work.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	Split between intuitive and observant mental energy. This creates a balance for ideas and later revisions.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	Split between thinking and feeling nature. However, two members are roughly defined as balanced in their thinking and feeling natures, while the other two are either outwardly thinking or feeling.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	Most lean on prospecting tactics, while Hao is more balanced, slightly leaning on the judging side.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	Most is turbulent, except for Hao, who is more assertive. Turbulent personalities are amiable to work with, though they are in need of an assertive personality to voice opinions and keep things going.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	In general, there are two diplomats and two explorers, which doesn’t really make up a good team. Diplomats are more like mediators and explorers are inventors, both types aren’t suited as leader. Thus, the team may feel disorganized as each member may tend to their own tasks without anyone to coordinate them.</span></p>
						<p><span style="font-size: x-large">-	Out of four members, Truc is the most creative. She and Hao are the bold and curious ones in the team, while Dat and Quan are the logical ones. This means Truc and Hao are the probable brains of the project, while the other two would share their opinions as to whether the idea is feasible or not.</span></p>

						<p><span style="font-size: larger">*Individual career plans</span></p>
						<h4><span style="font-size: xx-large;color: cadetblue"> How similar or different are your career plans across the group?</span></h4>
						<p><span style="font-size: large"> It is quite obvious that the plan that I (ĐẠT) had for my future career is pretty much similar to other members of my groups (2 (included me) out of 5 to be exactly). Our main purpose is to focusing on graduating college with some intermediate experience and knowledge in the field (such as, time management, communicating, team work, etc..) then aiming for the master degree of our major. And along the way, we could learn more about our future job through small project with other people, internships or even by trying to create and accomplish a project of our own. Without having forget to equipped us with some more fundamental knowledge for our job, in order to do this, some enroll in courses with the aim of having more certificates to prepare for their future job as well as strengthening their skills
								So what set us different from the other members is that Regarding the other three members of our team, instead of taking on a projects after graduating from college and learn about things along the way. A much safer approach of them is to focusing on preparing them self for the job, to be more specific, they will start to enroll in courses and trying to get the certificates right away. This is clearly a more suitable approach because trying to bite off more than one can chew can be too risky, trying to participate in a project while learning things on the way can be difficult and exhausted at the same time. However, I think that this approach is more appropriate for people who love to take risk and enjoy having some new worthwhile experiences, like we do. But when we break down the fact in term of our job, it is clearly that our job, which is game developer and Technical writer, will have to require a lot of working experience and it will provide us a higher chance to get a qualified job if I have already done a past project. On the other hand, the job of three members, which are cyber security and information security analysis will require more theoretical knowledge compare to our job, that is why they have to focus on accomplishing their course to attain the certificates instead of trying to get experiences through projects

							<h2>Clouds,services,servers</h2>
							<h3>What does it do? </h3>
							<h4></h4>
							<img src="img/cloud.png">
							<p>Clouds is a word that use to express the ability to host a software platform or a service without having had to host a typical server. This can be done regardless of location and can also be accessible to anyone via internet access
								Cloud services are introduced to the public in three main distinctive type of services, which are infrastructure-as-a-service  <strong>(IaaS)</strong>, platform-as-a-service <strong>(PaaS)</strong> and software-as-a-service <strong>(SaaS)</strong>, each is created with its own unique function and are used in different circumstances.
								To begin with infrastructure-as-a-service <strong>(IaaS)</strong> is mostly used to rent IT infrastructure, more specifically, servers and virtual machines, networks and operating systems can all be rent -  via a cloud provider and require a pay-as-you-go basis to get access to these infrastructures
								While the second computing type platform-as-a-service <trong>(PaaS)</trong>, gives the developers the tools to build and host web applications. Which mean instead of renting infrastructure from others providers, the second type give users access to the components the need to create and operate web or mobile applications on the internet rapidly. For instance, Magento Commerce Cloud, Apache, etc…
								And last but not least is the software-as-a-service <strong>(SaaS)</strong>, this last type of service is commonly used for web-based applications. SaaS allow user to deliver their applications over the internet where the cloud providers host, which make it easier to have the same application on all various devices at once by simply accessing it to the cloud system. One example of this type is the google apps
							Cloud servers are virtual severs (Unlike the usual manually hosted server or so call physical servers) running in a cloud computing environment. These servers can be created, hosted and be accessed remotely via a cloud computing platform by using the internet.
							</p>
							<h3>What is the state of the art of this new technology? </h3>
							<p>In this modern era, the application of cloud computing in all facets of society is inevitable. For instance, most of the leading company among IT companies are investing an enormous amount of their company budget in cloud computing, and these including IBM, Google and Microsoft. This can be attributed to the impactful advantages of cloud computing, which are (1) the mobility that allow user to get access to the main part of an application or software that they need without having had to buy the whole apps, (2) no file storage space is required on that device since it’s provided by the provider, and (3) a flexibility in collaboration among multiple users on documents stored in the cloud.
							</p>
							<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
							<p>According to an article, ‘1 Intelligence agencies are moving to cloud computing to integrate computer and information systems and share data.2 And, as an example within the states, the Kentucky Department of Education has moved to cloud-based services for some 700,000 students, faculty, and staffstatewide, replacing 180 on-premise exchange servers and saving an estimated $6.3 million in operational costs over four years.3 One industry commentator states that cloud computing has become so broadly accepted that it won't rank as an exciting development for 2012’
Dixon, Herbert B, Jr . The Judges' Journal ; Chicago  Vol. 51, Iss. 2,  (Spring 2012): 36-38.
And the reasons that cloud computing is going viral are easy to comprehend. Both businesses and individuals need to have access to their files on multiple devices and platforms and cloud computing can provide this easily. Besides, the fast internet connection is also an exclusive strength of cloud computing, having allow users to access files from each of the server easier and more convenient. Finally, the cost of cloud computing is affordable to everyone’s economic reach
Despite the massive impacts of cloud computing, there are still some significant drawbacks and alarming dilemma. One first thing to be aware of is that not all cloud provider services are equal. Some mainly focus on the stability and durability of their network while important factors such as the use and quality of their services are neglected. Moreover, regarding the aspect of security, there are cases where a burglar entered a physical place and stole valuables data from the owner, Scammers are able to use their trick on computer users, lure them into revealing their passcodes and IDs, not only that but they can also send Trojan viruses to the operating systems of computing devices, which result in critical damage to the main frame and a substantial loss of important data as well as the user’s information.
</p>
							<h3>What can be done now?</h3>
							<p>More than any approaches, the best defense against cyber-theives is to use a cloud server with a condensed layer of security. Cloud computing might be vulnerable to some inevitable threats, however, it also has several advantages that contribute to the growth of your business. Despite the minor flaws, cloud computing is still an outstanding system with advance operations. Moreover, cloud service is always improving from time to time. It is believed that the future of cloud computing will become more elaborated and sophisticated in management. But the first thing you should do now is to find a credible and good cloud service provider.
This is also believed by most specialists in the IT field, according to an online It blogger, ‘what you need to do to overcome the shortcomings in cloud computing is to find service providers who want to provide your business needs and ensure the security of your server. In addition, inadequate infrastructure is one of the problems that is often experienced, for this you can also use Cloud Hybird where service providers will handle the transition and reduce time & costs greatly using personnel and technology for your business.’

</p>
							<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
							<p>Cloud computing is a wonderful invention of mankind. it contributes not only to business but also to the user of the services. It is also extremely beneficial to school goers or college student regarding to their study. Take my-self as an example, due to cloud computing, it is possible for me to get access to useful application such as google drive, outlook without having to spend any money as well as download the apps to my computer since it allows user to get access via internet.
Without this invention, many big and impactful businesses such as GE (general electric) or eBay might not have achieved such success as they have today. Additionally, it also has a significant impact on the life of every citizen who gain a huge benefit from this advance technology. If this is the case, the development of many field might be decreased drastically for the developers had to spend more budget on various purposes such as hosting a physical server, in order to sustain their work and it is still, without any doubt, not as efficient as if when there was cloud computing take place.

							<h2>Robots</h2>
							<img src="img/robot.png">
							<h3>What is the state of the art of robot?</h3>
							<h4></h4>
							<p>According to my research, 2 best robots in the world so far are:</p>
							<p><strong>ASIMO:</strong> a humanoid robot by Honda, created in 2000. It has been continually developed and it is said to be one of the world most advanced social robots. ASIMO can move objects, postures, gestures, can understand and analyze it’s surrounding environment, it can also interact with humans. ASIMO is unique as it is said to be the most physically capable robot which has the ability to run, walk or even climb stairs.</p>
							<p><strong>Valkyrie robot:</strong> created by NASA in collaboration with University of Edinburg. Valkyrie is designed to operated in hazardous or damaged human-engineered environments. It has the ability to one day assist the setup of habitats prior to astronauts arrival.</p>
							<p><strong>Paro:</strong> it is a therapeutic robot with the appearance of a baby seal. It created for animal-assisted therapy to calm people down, this help avoid problems associated with live animals. Paro responds to petting and interaction by wagging its tail, opening and closing its eyes. Paro even actively seeks for eye contact, it responds to touch and cuddle with people, just like real animal.</p>
							<h3>What can be done now?</h3>
							<p><strong>Automated transportation:</strong> this  is not a robot that can drive cars, in fact, the cars are made like robots that can drive itself and may include AI. </p>
							<p><strong>Security, defense and surveillance:</strong> robots can survey specific area can spot immediately any type of disturbance occurred. In military, robots are used for tasks that are dangerous for soldier such as arming and disarming bombs, monitoring enemy’s area. we can also use robots to protect our home and properties, especially when we are away.</p>
							<p><strong>Medicine:</strong> robotics has undeniable impact on this field. Surgical robots can carry out operation with even better accuracy than human; Pharmacy robot can dispense pills and medicine, they can choose doses of medicine that suits the best with the pathological signs of the patient, which is not only more effective but can also help reduce side effects.</p>
							<p><strong>Exploring space:</strong> scientists send robots into space to collect data, photos and samples of their destination back to Earth, minimizing the loss of human lives. Sending robots is cheaper than sending real humans as they don’t need to eat, sleep or go to the bathroom, they can work continuously without resting. They survive in space easier as they are enable to withstand extreme conditions. Furthermore, they can be left out there when missions finished, no need return trip.</p>
							<p><strong>Industrial robot:</strong> robots have high endurance and excellent accuracy, they also work with greater speed. They can be used for repetitive tasks, manufacturing, packing, etc. and work that requires strength such as lifting objects.</p>
							<h3>What is likely to be able to be done soon?</h3>
							<p><strong>1. Robotics in public security</strong></p>
							<p>Artificial technology for predicting and detecting crime might seem far-fetched, but it's quite possible for the future we’re looking at. Drone footage, for instance, will make that happen soon. In addition, automatic recognition of suspicious activities is already a reality for camera-based security systems.

This technology will change society in a very important way: it will allow law enforcement officials to act quickly whenever a suspicious behavior has been spotted.

</p>
							<p><strong>2. Robots in education</strong></p>
							<p>The line between classrooms and individual learning settings is already starting to blur. As Kendra Roberts, an educational expert from Essays.ScholarAdvisor, explains, “A single teacher does not have the capacity to meet the needs of personalized learning for every single student in the classroom. Computer-based learning is already changing things in that matter. It’s not replacing the teacher, but it enables students to learn at their own pace.”

Robots will boost the process of personalized learning. NAO, the humanoid robot, is already forming bonds with students from around the world. It comes with important senses of natural interaction, including moving, listening, speaking, and connecting.
</p>
							<p><strong>3. Robots at home</strong></p>
							<p>Cloud-connected home robots are already becoming part of our lives. We can set up the vacuum cleaner to do the chore for us, and we can schedule a warm home-cooked meal to be ready by the time we’re finished with work. Multi-function robotic cookers are able to fry, steam, bake, slow cook, and perform any other action without our intervention. We just set them up.These cloud-connected robots are likely to evolve into more advanced version. We expect to see speech comprehension and increased interactions with humans in the upcoming years. These developments may end up changing the entire look and feel of our homes!</p>
							<p><strong>4. Robots as coworkers</strong></p>
							<p>Robots will have a profound effect on the workplace of the future. They'll become capable of taking on multiple roles in an organization, so it’s time for us to start thinking about the way we’ll interact with our new coworkers.

The machines will likely evolve more in terms of voice recognition, so we’ll be communicating with them through voice commands. This is how futurist Nikolas Badminton expect things to develop: “You’re probably going to walk into an office and your system’s been churning over the last couple of hours considering what’s been going on in business, your role, your job, what you need to do that day, and probably offer up several ideas about the right direction of what to do.”

</p>
							<p><strong>5. Robots might take our jobs</strong></p>
							<p>Whether we like it or not, robots have already replaced many people in their jobs. The jobs in office administration, logistics, and transport are also at risk of being replaced. Remember autonomous vehicles? Well, we might see them in the form of big trucks on the roads in future.

A study by Ball State University predicted that many occupations are at risk of being automated, including insurance underwriters, telemarketers, and tax-return preparers. To be more precise, robots are expected to take over half of all low-skilled jobs.


</p>
							<p><strong>6. They create jobs, too</strong></p>
							<p>“Robots will take our jobs!” is perhaps the most common fear surrounding robotics development. Yes, technology is changing fast and it does have economic ramifications. Driverless cars, for instance, are highly likely to replace cab drivers in the future.

In the near future, however, artificial intelligence will most likely replace tasks, not jobs. The good news is that it will also create new markets and jobs. We might need additional education and re-training for those jobs, but the opportunities will be there.
</p>
							<p><strong>7. Autonomous cars</strong></p>
							<p>Self-driving cars still require some human intervention, but we’re getting closer to the day when they won't. In the past decade, the perception of this technology among the public went from “How is it even possible?” to “Maybe it’s possible...” to “Definitely getting there!”

Waymo, the company that arose from the self-driving car project by Google, no longer has a monopoly on this industry. Instead, every significant automobile producer is pursuing this technology, with Uber being one of the strongest players. The users of this service can now get matched with a self-driving Uber when they request the service, so they can get a glimpse of the future.
</p>
							<p><strong>8. Healthcare robots</strong></p>
							<p>We’re looking into a different future for healthcare, too. Instead of visiting a primary care physician who will give us a check-up with a simple stethoscope, we’ll have intelligent robots performing these tasks. They will interact with patients, check on their conditions, and evaluate the need for further appointments.

Pharmabotics will bring more huge changes. They'll be like ATMs for medicines, so we can get the medications we need while avoiding the inconvenience of talking to a stranger about our health issues.

</p>
							<p><strong>9. Robotics for entertainment</strong></p>
							<p>Robots are getting more personalized, interactive, and engaging than ever. With the growth of this industry, virtual reality will enter our homes in the near future. We’ll be able to interact with our home entertainment systems through conversations, and they will respond to our attempts to communicate.

</p>
							<p><strong>10. Robots will boost our standard of living</strong></p>
							<p>We’ve seen this throughout history: automation and mechanization boosts the overall standard of living. We’ve seen it with the Industrial Revolution, and it’s going to happen again. According to estimates from the United Nations, poverty was reduced to a greater extent over the past five decades than in the previous 50. That’s because the global economy grew sevenfold, and technology played a huge part in that progress.</p>

							<h3>What technological or other developments make this possible?</h3>
							<p><strong>Computer vision.</strong></p>
							<p><strong>Natural language processing (NLP)</strong> – use human voice commands to a robot.</>
							<p><strong> Edge computing </strong>– computing that can be done at or near the source of data, not relying too much on Cloud.</p>
							<p><strong>Complex event process</strong>– tracking and analyzing information about things that happens so that it can respond as quick as possible.</p>
							<p><strong>Transfer learning and AI</strong> -  use knowledge gained from solving one problem and reapply it into solving similar problems</p>
							<p><strong>Hardware acceleration for AI</strong> – computer hardware specially made to perform functions more efficiently as possible.</p>
							<p><strong>Reinforcement learning</strong>– provide framework to design sophisticated and hard-to-engineer behaviors</p>
							<p><strong>Generative adversarial networks (GANs)</strong> – use to get better data, even in areas that data is not easy to come.</p>
							<p><strong>Mixed reality</strong> – use combination of physical and virtual objects to create a prototype mechanism for algorithms.</p>
							<p><strong>Emotion research</strong>– affective computing – systems and devices that recognize, interpret and simulate human emotions.</p>

							<h3>What is the potential impact of robots?</h3>
							<p>Robots will literally have impact on every aspects of the society: economy, industries, businesses, security, politics world’s peace and our daily life. Robots are changing the world gradually as they help humans do thing better and easier, even things that weren’t possible before. With the help of robots, it enable humankind kind to do things that used to be beyond our ability. </p>
							<h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
							<p>Everything is likely to change in a more positive ways as robots are meant to help us with our life, things will be done easier and faster, with higher accuracy and better quality  thanks to the help of robots. everything has pros and cons, but so far, the pros of robots have outweighed the cons and it promises many positive opportunities for our future. </p>
							<h3>Which people will be most affected and how?</h3>
							<p>Robots will definitely impact lower-skilled people. They can be replaced with robots as robots can do their job but with better performance, greater speed and higher accuracy. Better working efficiency creates profits, there seem to be no reasons not using robots instead of low-skilled workers.</p>
							<h3>Will this create, replace or make redundant any current jobs or technologies?</h3>
							<p>Based on current situation, jobs like factory workers, pharmacists, drivers, customer service executives, bookkeeping and data entry, receptionists, proofreading, etc. will have very high potential to be replaced, which will lead to redundancy in those jobs.

Those people cannot do anything but to retrain themselves, they can’t rely on government to stop their jobs being taken away by technology.  On the contrary, jobs related to technology and robotics will be in high demand. However, for every job created by technology and automation, several more will be eliminated.
For thousands of years, humans have always been able to create new job, a century ago most of our ancestors were farmers and more and more jobs were created due to our need at different stage of time. Personally, I don’t believe we can’t be made redundant that easily because of automation.
But we are automating jobs faster than creating them so this problem is quite hard, only time can tell.
</p>
						<h3>In your daily life, how will this affect you? What will be different for you? How might this affect members of your family or your friends?</h3>
						<p>To be honest, the impact of robots can only be clearly seen in developed countries, Vietnam is still in its developing stage and might takes a few more decades before it really affects our life. It is undeniable we are getting more and more modern and better than ever before but the impact is only fractional compared to that of developed countries, so I will say that it hasn’t had much effects on us so far.</p>

							<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
							<img src="img/machine-learning.png">
							<h3>What does it do?</h3>
							<p>	Machine learning is a tool that can help us search, and seek answers for our questions. Basically machine learning use algorithms and data in order to perform task even there is no actions from the user. These AI are autonomous so it can improve itself through examples, errors, calculation.
								Eventually they do not need input from human anymore. We can call machine learning is an aspect of AI (artificial intelligent). At the moment machine learning play a major role in artificial intelligence apps, it help AI to detect the data which suitable to use in typical situation without human analysis. Machine learning can answer all the questions that users would like to ask. There are several apps which represent for this content such as google, chat bot(youtube,discord,twitch).  This tool also contribute in medical field, it play a critical role in billing, medical records. There are eight ways that machine learning can be used in medical treatment(identifying diseases and diagnosis, drug discovery and manufacturing , medical imaging diagnosis, personalized medicine , machine leaning- base behavioral modification, smart health records. Clinical trial and research , crowdsourced data collection, better Radiotherapy, outbreak prediction). First step is help doctor to diagnosis accurately and this is a crucial step a big change for the patient, because if the doctor can not find out what is wrong with his/her patient then they can not help them to get a right treatment. After that is drug, this is one of the most important part when machine learning will find out what is the best medicine for the patient at the current stage. The amazing thing about machine learning is check the patient heal records to avoid pills that can be harmed for them, this is quite nice because do not remember the name of the drug which have side effects on them. Chatbot is an AI software replicate a conversation, these chatbots can be used in messages, webs and some mobile apps. Usually chatbot will be setting in order to reply users and provide significant informations, the are some bots which use to make warning to users who are using bad language in order to maintain discipline in a sever, webpage or chatroom. The other reasons why we have chatbot are service improvement and new way of approaching potential customers, by this way those companies may reduce a big amount of money for advertising but can still remain the quality of their service. Another field in machine learning is robotic. Robot have 4  tenents which link to machine learning. Those are vision( AI is supporting robots to find stuffs they have never seen before, so it will help them realize more specific detail.). Secondly is about grasping, robots sometimes grasp thing that they have touch for the first time so they do not know which position is the ideal for them to get those items, but with machine learning it can help robot do it easily. Lastly is data, basically AI and machine learning make the robot to learn about physical to make it to be more productive. I think in the next 3 years machine learning will be the tool for AI and robots to work without any input from us to them, it would be possible because most factories at the current time all using high advance technology to do all the crafting work, they just need a few workers who know to use those things. Therefore the company can save money from paying salary for the employees. So in the next 3 years some factories may not need workers anymore, they just need people who can control the whole system through software.

							</p>
							<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
							<p>2.	As my perspective all three fields are impacted by the raise of the machine learning. In medical we have system that can diagnosis more accurate than a regular doctor, because some part of our body is hard for the doctor to see through. Usually the computer system identify the patient problem, because it already had data of all kind of illness or diseases, so it know all situations can happen when a patient hurts a typical part of their bodies .Further more these tools also save the patient profile, so the computer can check the history of illness, when the patients get it, what kind of medicine did they take and what need to be avoided. It obviously machine learning have contribute a major role in the medical field and it will have more improvement in the future In order to help the doctor treat their patient as best as they can. In another aspect chatbot field have changed the service field since it came out, in the past companies need to hire numerous employees to stay contact with customers, so with chatbot they can reduce the big amount of money for those workers and. Chatbot also enhance companies service quality, because they are setting to answer questions which customers want with no mistakes. In the end workers In service field will be struggled to find their job, because each bot can handle a bunch of information and they also answer customer immediately without repeating consumer questions. In the near future chatbot is going to replace most of workers in the service field, because at that time they might answer customers by voice chat, which is a big change from texting. </p>

							<h3>How will this affect you? </h3>
							<p>3.	The improvement of machine learning might effect me and my family members but in a positive way. First of all is the chatbot, they did steal away many jobs but I have to admit that those bot provide important information whenever I buy supply, cloths or other stuffs. It is super convenience, there is no need to way for the service man/woman or customer care, all I want to know will be provided after I ask the bot. This kind of machine learning is an appropriate tool for the online shopping, because it can help consumers choose their best. Secondly about medical, machine learning did help my aunt.It helped doctors to detected cancer from my 2 aunts ,they both got detected in the early age so that is quite a good news to hear. At the early age the chance to cure and make this disease disappear is quite high so my aunts can have a normal happy life again. It did reduce the amount of money for medicine and treatment in a passive way for both of my aunts. Next is machine learning in robotic field, I have to say there is no impact for me neither my family. Farthermore high advance technology in Vietnamese  rare therefore seeing a robot to do work is difficult. The only time that I can see robot do all the work in the factory when I was grade 7, we came to Yakult factory and I was shock how modern was that factory, most of the workers checked the final result of the products because all the robotics hand did the heavy job. Overall machine learning play a critical role in my life time and my family, the biggest appreciate was system which can detected my aunts cancer and treated it right away.

							<h2>Cybersecurity</h2>
							<img src="img/cybersecurity.png">
							<h3>State of the art of cybersecurity:</h3>
							<p>• Hardware authentication: This method is about baking authentication into a user's hardware. It can combine a variety of hardware-enhanced factors at the same time to validate a user's identity (John 2017).</p>
							<p>• User-behavior analytics: This technology uses big data analytics to identify anomalous behavior by a user (John 2017).</p>
							<p>• Data loss prevention: A key to data loss prevention is technologies such as encryption and tokenization. They can protect data down to field and subfield level, which can benefit an enterprise in a number of ways (cyber-attackers cannot monetize data in the event of a successful breach, data can be securely moved and used across the extended enterprise) (John 2017).</p>
							<p>• Deep learning: This technology encompasses a number of technologies, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. Like user behavior analytics, deep learning focuses on anomalous behavior (John 2017).</p>
							<p>• The cloud: More organizations use the cloud for what has traditionally been the domain of on-premises IT, more approaches to security that are born in and for the cloud will appear (John 2017).</p>
							<p><span style="font-style: italic">John P. Mello Jr. 2017. “5 emerging security technologies set to level the battlefield.” TechBeacon, accessed December 3, 2019. <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/5-emerging-security-technologies-set-level-battlefield.">https://techbeacon.com/security/5-emerging-security-technologies-set-level-battlefield.</a> </span></p>
							<h3>What can be done?</h3>
							<p>The transformation of the digital techonology has changed our world. While technology is a  major driver for achieving economic and social advantages, it also presents new challenges in terms of security. Cybersecurity is behind most organizations' cutting-edge, which means that robust safety is not offered. Increasing assaults and violations are damaging individuals and organizations.
								Research and innovation will allow cyber security to catch up with changing cyber risks. This helps in building a digital environment of trust and resilience. A more ambitious and challenge-driven research funding organization should be established to support progress in cybersecurity research and research should be pursued which incorporates perspectives from various disciplines and around the world.
							</p>
							<h3>What is likely to be able to be done soon?</h3>
							<p>•	Utilization of data across the enterprise – As data is shared across an organization, it must be secured. Industry will recognize how the application of data models can result in better, more effective security (Sean 2019).</p>
							<p>•	Security assessments – The number of businesses that are required to provide some form of security assessment, audit report, or attestation will increase along with general cybersecurity awareness (Sean 2019). </p>
							<p>•	Moving to the cloud: Organizations are shifting their workloads into the cloud as their on-premises systems become end-of-life and they look to leverage the latest technology and tools available (Brian 2019). </p>
							<p>•	Log monitoring in cloud environments: With new tools to help sift through large amounts of data, security specialists will be looking to take advantage of automation, enhanced visibility, and alerting (Angelo 2019).</p>
							<p>•	Blurred lines related to legacy computer networks: As systems are moved to the cloud and as more of today’s workforce shifts to a remote working environment, a blurred line of where enterprise data lives and who is responsible for its integrity will be seen. This presents cybersecurity challenges as data moves out of the enterprise environment and onto shared systems like mobile workstations and virtual machines (Brian 2019).</p>
							<p><span style="font-style: italic">“Cybersecurity Trends for 2019”. CISecurity, accessed December 5, 2019. <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/cybersecurity-trends-for-2019.">https://www.cisecurity.org/blog/cybersecurity-trends-for-2019.</a></span></p>
							<h3>Potential impact of cybersecurity</h3>
							<p>•	Vulnerable big data: Most people nowadays generate and store massive amount of data using smartphones and other browsing devices. The rapidly increasing number of these devices has led to data distributed uncontrollably. People post photos and videos in real time to social platforms, not being aware of their exposure to cyber criminals. There have also been certain social networks accused with leaking data for political purpose.</p>
							<p>•	Cloud security: The more developed cloud infrastructure is, the more attractive a target it will become for cyber criminals. Because big companies are trying to protect their data, there is a high demand for expertise in this area. Some of the greatest risks to cloud infrastructure include data breach, system vulnerabilities, hijacked accounts and malware attacks.</p>
							<p>•	Intrusion detection: This is one of the must-have and in-demand skills in cybersecurity. Intrusion detection involves identifying and minimizing the consequences of malicious cyber activity. Breaches can now be detected from outside or inside a system or organization. Intrusion detection helps developing a prevention or mitigation plan for future risks so that organizations will react quicker. </p>
							<h3>What is likely to change?</h3>
							<p>•	In 2019 and beyond, companies that process large volumes of personal data and companies that provide software/hardware/services used by financial, healthcare and retail sectors will continue to be targeted by hackers…” (Marzena Fuller 2019).</p>
							<p>•	The future of cybersecurity will center around industry adoption of 5G networks. 5G technology will enable billons of new devices to be connected to the Internet – with more speed, density and efficiency than ever seen before (Ryan Webber 2019).</p>
							<p>•	The future of cybersecurity is going to include humans working alongside automated assistants, where AI/ML assist in operations (Joshua Davis 2019).</p>
							<p>•	In the future, cybersecurity will focus more on the security controls related to adoption of IaaS and use of SaaS applications and continue to evolve to secure newer technologies like containerization as it becomes mainstream. Cybersecurity will also continue to become more ingrained into the newer devops model of software introduction (Frances Dinha 2019).</p>
							<p>•	The future of cybersecurity will be led by a workforce that intentionally studied cybersecurity, rather than fell into it as a default (Mike Stamas 2019).</p>

Disruptor Daily, accessed December 6, 2019. <a href="https://www.disruptordaily.com/future-of-cybersecurity.">https://www.disruptordaily.com/future-of-cybersecurity.</a></span></p>
							<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
							<p>In my opinion, cybersecurity can impact on human privacy and freedom of expression. Some policies created to protect the Internet and other information communication technologies can be overly broad by restricting the free flow of information. For example, US companies such as Google and Facebook face stricter censorship due to the new Vietnam cybersecurity law that took effect in January 1, 2019.</p>

							<h3><span style="color: indigo">Hảo's feedback</span></h3>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Truc: </strong> I believe she has the right qualities of a leader, although, for some reasons, she doesn’t believe so. Truc is diligent and focused on the tasks. She puts great emphasis on performance, though not so much on coherent teamwork. Therefore, there have appeared many problems among team members, but not so many on overall performance.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Dat: </strong>He is very eager to take on any task. Hardworking as he is, he’s not without flaws. Dat is slightly slobby with presentation in general, making it hard to decipher what point he’s trying to get across. He’s also very verbose – his reports are often draught with unnecessary wordings and repetitions. On the plus side, he contributes to a majority of our work and always submits early.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Phuc: </strong>He’s good with coming up with ideas and solutions to errors in those ideas. He takes on his duty seriously enough, but I feel he’s still a bit distanced from the team, and sometimes he appears distracted.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Quan: </strong>His nonappearance during meetings, physically and virtually, is frustrating. He rarely voices his opinions and replies to messages online. It’s hard to keep track of him and his progress. (•ˋ _ ˊ•)</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Hao: </strong>I think I am pretty laconic in the team. I may provide some ideas and assumes mundane, non-technical tasks for the team. My contribution seems not enough for my liking, and I’m often absent on the online chat only to return with no context of the conversation taking place. I can reassure myself that at least I submit my work on time. ●︿●</span></p>
						</li>
						<li>

							<h3><span style="color: indigo">Quân's feedback</span></h3>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Hao: </strong>I think Hao has the boldness and curiosity to learn more and more. I see herself as Truc’s second-in-command. Hao can perceive and judge things pretty quickly. Her working speed is astonishing, probbably the fastest in our group. </span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Dat: </strong>Probably the best male groupate in terms of participation. I can see his enthusiasm whenever he’s given a task. He sometimes provides some misunderstandings to me due to his incomplete presentation but that’s all good. Me and Phuc can learn a lot from Dat’s productivity. </span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Phuc: </strong>This guy often presented interesting ideas and has the potential to be a good IT professional in the future with his creative mind. However, I think he’s the second least active member in our group. Even me, the most inactive member had to wonder where on Earth is this guy all time. </span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Truc: </strong>Vision, influence and confidence are the qualities that make her a great group leader. I really like the way she divide all the work and assign tasks to each member. She’s such a helpful person who always offers answers to all my questions.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Quan: </strong>I feel like I hadn’t been active enough for the group. I was often absent when a group member sent me messages and when group leader set an appointment. Although I got my work done in time, my working speed is nowhere near other members’. I need to improve my work rate and group ethic in the futture in order to not slow down the group progress.</span></p>
						</li>

						<li>

							<h3><span style="color: indigo">Trúc's feedback</span></h3>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Hao: </strong>She is very talented, dedicated and funny. She is, undoubtedly, the best member of our group and
also one of the most talented person I have ever known. Talented as she is, she usually got
distracted, moreover she has to wait for inspiration to come in order to work her best, which
doesn't affect much but this is probably her weakness.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Dat: </strong>He is a great teammate with high sense of responsibility and dedication, very hardworking
and always willing to help his teammate. He is the one that you can always count on. However,
he doesn't speak much and quite shy, which sometimes makes it quite difficult to get his idea
across. He go to sleeps early and might miss important things if the team is working in late hours.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Quan: </strong>He is smart and has such great understanding. However, his enthusiasm for work isn't enough
.It also takes him quite a long time to finish his work.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Phuc: </strong>He got distracted easily. He has potential and if he put more effort into his work, the
result will be stunning. He got sick  and he didn't contribute much to this assignment but it wasn't a big deal to us.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Truc: </strong></span>I didn't fulfill my responsibility as the group's leader which caused us difficulties when working.
Hope that I can improve myself so that I won't let my friends down.</p>
							<p>My teammates are all wonderful, I know that. I hope that we can improve ourselves together and we will be able to perform much better in the future.</p>

							<h3><span style="color: indigo">Đạt's feedback</span></h3>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Truc: </strong>she is a clever and hard-working person, who is always try her best to keep everyone in our group on the right tract as a leader of our group. Not only that she is capable of finishing her part of work excellently but she also managed to keep track of other members works and give us guilds on how to improve our part. However, it is still kind of a struggle for Truc to actually tell us about what we have to do, this can be attribute to her shy personality. Overall, I think that if she can improve on this minor detail, she should definitely improve.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Hao: </strong> A dedicated person who always pay attention to the most insignificant detail in order to deliver a perfect final product. With high working efficiency and great concentration, Hảo always finish her work faster than normal compare to everyone else. But her only weakness, in my opinion, is that she is not always reluctant to take in other member opinions, which make it more difficult for our group to communicate.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Phuc: </strong>Overall, I think phuc is a person who can thrive in doing any things, as long as him can put his mind into it, the result will be mind-blowing. But unfortunately, throughout the time working on assignment 2, he did not seem to be very enthusiastic and it is kind of like he did not try his best in the time we working on this assignment. It is understandable because he has some intense business to deal with so that he could not thoroughly focus on his work and I and every other member known and sympathized with him. However, in the future it is still best not to let your like matters affects your works, this is a professional characteristic that is required to have as a modern citizen in this era so if he could improve on this one, I think that he would perform so much better in the future.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Quan: </strong>In my regards, quan has a very good understanding in many problems and it is proven since he always has a great comprehension with the tasks that he was given very fast and always eager to take on comments to improve his work. But his only drawback is that it takes too much time for him to finish his works and it is also very difficult to set a group appointment with him for he is not available most of the time and this result in slow down our group progress for we do not know whether if him has finished his work so that we can provided him with new tasks. Overall, I believed that if he is willing to make changes to these things, he will definitely improve.</span></p>
							<p><span style="font-size: larger"><strong>Dat: </strong>I would not consider me as a smart person with great efficiency in working but I can surely assure that I am capable of finishing my job according to schedule, though may be delay but I managed to keep up with the pace in this assignment, my work though is not perfect and required many changes in order to improve so I think my weakness is that my skills set is not yet perfect and i need to improve on this aspect of mine in order to improve</span></p>

						<h2>Group's reflection</h2>


					<p><strong><span style="font-size: x-large;color: cadetblue">This is our group's reflection.</span></strong></p>

					<p><span style="font-size: larger">*Click on dots below to see each member's reflection.</span></p>

					<div class="review-slider owl-carousel">
						<div class="single-review">
							<p><span style="font-size: larger">It always surprised me how easily our team reach a consensus on certain matters. There was almost no fuss when tasks were delegated, and everyone was ready to help each other when there was any trouble. Reports came quickly and got fixed equally swiftly. It was surprisingly efficient in my opinion. However, I think it was due to lack of time and the looming presence of deadline that made everyone so malleable and rapid to whatever tasks they were given.
In my opinion, our team is not very organized, although it doesn’t come as a surprise to me. I think that we had too little time interacting with each other outside of class to properly know each other’s personalities, strengths and weaknesses. For there was little time to finish the assignment, reports were often careless and lacked any real substance to them. We spent a lot of time deciding on the project idea also, the significance of which made us fail to polish other parts of the assignment properly. We didn’t really altogether review each other’s reports, so there is a certain degree of discrepancy in the content of the assignment in general. Only the team leader vetted the final product, which didn’t really reflect each member’s efforts and conceptions of their work.
What surprised me was that we managed to get an interview with an IT professional. We were really lucky to land upon such an opportunity, and it was thanks to our illustrious leader. Another thing that surprised me was the relevance of my ideal occupation. At first glance, it seemed that it wasn’t a job in much demand, but it turned out that there would be an increasing demand after all.
After some time with the team, I have acquired some important lessons, the most important of which is that communication is important. One of the reasons of our team’s inefficiency was due to lack of communication. Team members, including myself, rarely voiced their opinions or hardships during the assignments. Only when one member raised the issue would others begin to speak up themselves. Another lesson I learned was that I couldn’t expect team members to work well on their first assignment. It seemed to be the problem with other groups in this assignment too, as far as I’m concerned: we were unfamiliar with each other so we shouldn’t expect to function like a well-oiled machine. There should be time to acclimate with our situation and a few more challenges to figure our way out.
Finally, regarding GitHub, I don’t think it is a good indicator as to who contribute more than another. It is true that our team used GitHub to submit reports to our leader, but it didn’t reflect the entire picture. Sometimes, we sent our reports on online chat to discuss together, then the leader incorporates that part into our assignments. Sometimes, we discussed ideas on the chat, which counts as participation, but it wouldn’t be recorded as such on GitHub. I think it is best to evaluate each member depending on other members’ opinions.
</span></p>
							<h3>Nguyễn Phạm Như Hảo</h3>

						</div>
						<div class="single-review">

							<p><span style="font-size: larger">Although at the beginning, it turned out that it was very difficult for our group members to interact with each other and discuss about the work revolving this assignment and due to this we let the first 2 weeks gone to waste, not completely waste since our group did manage to arrange a group appointment with full participation of each member, this was very good and we did discuss about many things, the project and stuffs. But on the contrary to the things we discussed in at the group meeting, the next two weeks since that day, we did not make any progress. And I soon realized the reasons behinds this unwanted result is that we did not have a leader at that point, which is contribute to the fact that there are no one to come up with the planning and moderating our group progress which explain why our group final result is not very good.
But what surprise is that we manage to get our shit together in that last week, regardless that there are still people who are not willing to understand and try at this pace, but if ignore those things, we did try very in this last stage in we have managed to give out the product though the limitation of our time.
One thing that I learned from my group is that, always find a leader as soon as you join a group to see whether if it has had one yet in order to prevent the bad scenario from happening in the future.
Regarding the github section, I do not thing that it is a very effective tool in term of keeping tract on our works. Though I think that the feature of it that allow us to know at which day that we have done what but the uploaded day on git is not very important. For example, a person can do a tons of work and just do not upload in regularly and only send those works on the last day, it clearly that person have contributed more than everyone else but github also log of activity reflects also based on how often do you contribute things which is kind of unfair.
So in the end, I do not thing that git is really a good option in term of keeping recorded of our works

							<p><span style="font-size: larger">•	From my perspective, each member contributed and did their parts. We had no internal conflicts and complied well with the group leader. The intial progress was slow but there was everything went well in the end. The completion of this assignment proved that.
•	I believe the leader selection progress took quite long. We couldn’t decide who would be our group leader on the first meeting due to most of group members are introverts. Because of that, we had a slow begin but things started to change in a different direction when Truc volunteered to be the leader.
•	What surprised me the most was that the interview with an IT professional who was a contact of our group leader went rather smoothly. I thought this was the hardest part but it turned out not to be that way.
•	After this assignment, I have learned that group interaction is very crucial in dealing with problems and roadblocks. Interaction helps us understand and know everyone’s strengths and weaknesses so we can compensate for each other.
•	I think Github can record our group partcipation to some degree but not the big picture.

							<p><span style="font-size: larger">Our team didn't interact much with each other and to be honest, we didn't cooperate very well. We had very little time to finish this assignment
as we spent so much time on deciding the project idea. However, everyone work so hard that finally (and luckily) we can still finish this assignment on time.
In my opinion, I don't think that github is a very useful tool to keep track of the contribution of the team, what github reflected doesn't show accurate
result about the work of my group. I mean it does help, but not that much.

						<h2>Project idea</h2>
					</div>



					<p><span style="font-size: larger">Food waste is becoming a larger problem as the years go by. According to  [1], about one-third of the world’s food is wasted or lost each year. The same article also pointed out that one of the main reasons of food waste is due to removal of foods that are either reaching or exceeding their expiry dates.</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-size: larger">Our team decided to tackle this problem. We chose to expand on a member’s existing idea and create an application with the topic of “smart home”. The main purposes of this app include keeping track of food expiry dates and simultaneously helping the user to reduce food waste by recommending some approachable options for those foods, such as cooking them with suggested recipes. The application will be called tinyfridge.</span></p>
					<p><span style="font-size: larger">We did some research online and found out that this type of project is quite popular. The need for a solution to food waste at homes is quite substantial. Most people usually fail to keep track of the expiry date of the foods they buy. Sometimes, they just completely forget that they have already had those foods at home, and not until they have bought more do they realize that there is an abundance at home. At the end of the day, most of the times when people encounter this situation, it is almost inevitable that there will be more food wasted.
From a similar project online, we managed to decipher what features users want to see in the app.</span></p>
					<img src="img/capture.png">
					<p><span style="font-size: larger">In our rough draft for the app, tinyfridge consists of a storage section which contains the foods that the users have at home, and a shopping list that takes the user’s input about their grocery buying list. When the user writes down in this list, it will point out what foods they already have based on the storage section. After having bought all the product they need, tinyfridge allows them to scan their shopping receipt and the purchase information will be updated to the storage section. Whenever an item is close to its expiry date, tinyfridge will send notification as well as the reminder for the user to look at the recipe section to know what to do with the nearly expired item. When the user accesses tinyfridge, what will be shown first is a calendar screen. The expiry dates of the foods currently in the storage section will be highlighted along with what item it is.  </span></p>
					<p><span style="font-size: larger">In the future, our also decide to add more features in order to make this app even more beneficial to users. We are considering adding an information section about the prices of foods people usually buy (based on their input) because, according to the figure, people are most interested in knowing how much money they spend on their sustenance. A food availability section also looks promising, although it will be difficult to implement such a feature. We are thinking of adding a health ratings section too, because health is important to users.</span></p>
